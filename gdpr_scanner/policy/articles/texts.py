A public list of adequacy decisions is maintained.",
    "Article 46": "In the absence of an adequacy decision, transfers to third countries or international organisations are permitted only if appropriate safeguards are in place and enforceable rights and effective legal remedies are available to data subjects. Safeguards can include legal instruments, binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses, approved codes of conduct, or certification mechanisms with enforceable commitments. Subject to authorisation, contractual clauses or administrative arrangements may also serve as safeguards. Legacy authorisations and decisions remain valid until updated.",
    "Article 47": "Binding corporate rules (BCRs) allow intra-group transfers of personal data and must be approved by the supervisory authority via the consistency mechanism.

Member States with multiple authorities must designate one to represent them in the Board and ensure internal compliance with consistency rules. Legal frameworks must be communicated to the Commission.",
    "Article 52": "Supervisory authorities must operate independently and free from external influence. Members must act autonomously, avoid incompatible roles, and not seek or accept instructions.

Financial oversight must not compromise independence, and authorities must maintain separate public budgets.",
    "Article 53": "Members of supervisory authorities are to be appointed via a transparent process by parliament, government, head of state, or another independent body.

Courts acting in judicial capacity are excluded from supervision.",
    "Article 56": "The lead supervisory authority is responsible for cross-border processing where the controller or processor has a main or single establishment. Local supervisory authorities can handle cases limited to their territory or affecting only local data subjects. Such authorities must inform the lead authority, which then decides within three weeks whether to assume the case. If it does, Article 60 applies; otherwise, the local authority proceeds. The lead authority acts as the sole contact point for the controller or processor.",
    "Article 57": "Supervisory authorities must enforce GDPR, raise public awareness (with special attention to children), advise governments, handle data subject complaints, conduct investigations, promote codes of conduct and certifications, maintain DPIA lists, and cooperate with other authorities and the Board. Their services are free unless requests are excessive or unfounded, in which case fees may apply.",
    "Article 58": "Authorities may investigate (e.g., request information, audits), correct (e.g., warnings, fines, data erasure), and authorize (e.g., codes of conduct, certifications). They may suspend data flows or take legal action to enforce GDPR. These powers must follow due process and allow judicial remedies. Member States may grant additional powers, provided they don't conflict with GDPR Chapter VII.",
    "Article 59": "Each supervisory authority must publish an annual activity report, which may list types of infringements and enforcement actions. This report is submitted to national authorities and made available to the public, the Commission, and the Board.",
    "Article 60": "The lead authority must collaborate with other supervisory authorities concerned to reach consensus on cross-border cases. Information is shared and draft decisions circulated. If objections arise, the consistency mechanism applies. When decisions are adopted, controllers must comply across all EU establishments. In urgent cases, Article 66 applies. All information exchange uses standardized electronic formats.",
    "Article 61": "Supervisory authorities must assist each other to ensure consistent GDPR application. This includes sharing relevant information, carrying out inspections, or consultations. Responses to requests must occur within one month. Refusals are limited to lack of competence or legal conflicts. Mutual assistance is usually free of charge and exchanged via standardized electronic formats. If information isn't provided on time, the requesting authority may take provisional action, triggering an urgent Board decision under Article 66.",
    "Article 62": "Supervisory authorities may carry out joint operations, especially in cross-border processing or where many data subjects are affected. Host authorities may delegate powers to seconding staff under local law. Host countries assume liability for damage caused by seconded personnel. Member States must reimburse each other for such damage where applicable. Failure to participate in joint operations within one month allows others to adopt provisional measures, presuming urgency under Article 66.",
    "Article 63": "Supervisory authorities shall cooperate using the consistency mechanism to ensure uniform GDPR enforcement across the EU. This mechanism includes information sharing and coordination with the Board and the Commission, especially for decisions affecting multiple Member States.",
    "Article 64": "The Board issues opinions on matters like DPIA lists, codes of conduct, standard clauses, and BCRs. Opinions can be requested by supervisory authorities, the Chair, or the Commission, especially when obligations under Articles 61 and 62 aren't followed. Opinions must be adopted in 8 weeks (extendable to 14 weeks) and communicated electronically. Authorities must notify whether they accept or reject the Board's opinion, and if rejected, Article 65 dispute resolution applies.",
    "Article 65": "The Board resolves disputes when there is disagreement between supervisory authorities, particularly over reasoned objections or failure to follow the consistency process. Binding decisions are adopted by a two-thirds majority (or simple majority if needed), and must be issued within one or two months depending on complexity. Final decisions must be published and followed by all involved authorities, with proper notification to data subjects, controllers, and the Board.",
    "Article 66": "In exceptional cases, supervisory authorities may immediately adopt provisional measures on their territory for up to three months, bypassing the usual consistency mechanism. These actions must be urgently communicated to other authorities, the Board, and the Commission. Any authority may request an urgent opinion or binding decision from the Board when rapid action is necessary. The Board must respond within two weeks.",
    "Article 67": "The Commission may establish implementing acts to define how information should be electronically exchanged between supervisory authorities and the Board, particularly using standardized formats referred to in Article 64.",
    "Article 68": "The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) is established with legal personality. It consists of heads of supervisory authorities and the European Data Protection Supervisor.

Fines can reach €10M/2% or €20M/4% of global turnover depending on the nature of the breach. Some Member States may impose fines via courts.",
    "Article 84": "Member States must establish penalties for GDPR infringements not subject to administrative fines and ensure they are effective, proportionate, and dissuasive. States must inform the Commission of such rules and any updates.",
